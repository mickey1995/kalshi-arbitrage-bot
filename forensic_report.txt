  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

  VERDICT: STRUCTURAL OVERPRICING DETECTED

  The data shows that longshot contracts (>2x payout) in the BTC-15M
  series systematically settle to $0 at a rate that EXCEEDS their
  implied probability. These are NOT fair bets.

  Overall Longshot EV per $1 bet:               $-0.3227
  Favorite wins at mid-window:                  76.5%

================================================================================
  SECTION 1: BRACKET ANALYSIS (Actual vs. Implied Win Rates)
================================================================================

  If markets are fairly priced, the 'Realized Win Rate' should
  approximately equal the 'Implied Win Rate' (price / $1.00).
  A significant gap = systematic overpricing or underpricing.

  ** NEGATIVE EDGE BUCKETS (The 'Trap' Zones) **
     10x-16x payouts: Market implies 8% win rate, actual is 6% (2pp worse)
     -> These contracts are ~1.3x OVERPRICED vs. reality
     4x-4.8x payouts: Market implies 23% win rate, actual is 17% (6pp worse)
     -> These contracts are ~1.4x OVERPRICED vs. reality
     2x-2.9x payouts: Market implies 42% win rate, actual is 38% (4pp worse)
     -> These contracts are ~1.1x OVERPRICED vs. reality

================================================================================
  SECTION 2: THE GOLDEN MINUTE TEST (T=10, >4x Payout)
================================================================================

  Hypothesis: 'If the payout exceeds 4x at the 10-minute mark,
  what is the actual probability of winning?'

  Contracts at T=10 with >4x payout:            136
  Wins:                                         10
  Actual win rate:                              7.4%
  Market-implied win rate:                      9.5%

  The actual and implied rates are close. Market is fairly priced at T=10.

================================================================================
  SECTION 3: POINT OF NO RETURN
================================================================================

  The exact minute and price where a contract's win probability
  effectively drops to 0%, regardless of the displayed payout.

    Minute  Price Below   Wins   Total  Win Rate   Confidence
  -------- ------------ ------ ------- --------- ------------
         5        $0.05      0       4     0.0%         weak
         5        $0.10      0      15     0.0%       strong
        13        $0.15      1     164     0.6%       strong
        13        $0.20      2     170     1.2%     moderate
        13        $0.25      3     179     1.7%     moderate
        14        $0.33      0     200     0.0%   definitive

  ** CRITICAL FINDING **
  At minute 5, if a contract is priced below $0.10,
  the observed win rate is 0.0% (n=15).
  ANY trade at that price/time combination is a GUARANTEED LOSS.
  The payout shown on the UI is MEANINGLESS at this point.

================================================================================
  SECTION 4: THE '27/29' VALIDATION
================================================================================

  Searching for rolling 30-trade windows where the 'Cheaper' side
  (the favorite) won more than 90% of the time.

  Found 10 sequences matching the pattern:

  #1: Favorite won 28/30 (93%) - Underdog won only 2 times
  #2: Favorite won 28/30 (93%) - Underdog won only 2 times
  #3: Favorite won 28/30 (93%) - Underdog won only 2 times
  #4: Favorite won 28/30 (93%) - Underdog won only 2 times
  #5: Favorite won 28/30 (93%) - Underdog won only 2 times

  ** WORST CASE: Favorite won 28 out of 30 **
  If you were betting the longshot (underdog) during this window,
  you would have lost 28 out of 30 bets.
  This MATCHES the '27/29' pattern described in the hypothesis.

================================================================================
  SECTION 5: TIME DECAY ANALYSIS (The 'Noise Zone')
================================================================================

  Average price of the LOSING side at each minute.
  Shows how 'attractive' the losing bet looked before collapsing.

        14 $          0.01          180.2x           

  ** The 'Noise Zone' **
  In the last 5 minutes (minute 10-14), losing contracts still show
  an average price of $0.14 (implied 7.2x payout).
  These are the 'zombie' contracts - they look alive but are already dead.

================================================================================
  SECTION 6: MANIPULATION ATTRIBUTION (Spot-Lag Analysis)
================================================================================

  Compares Kalshi BTC-15M prices against Binance BTC/USD spot
  to detect information asymmetry and latency traps.

  Markets with spot data:                       200
  Average spot range (15m window):              0.277%
  Average Kalshi-Spot correlation:              0.266
  Estimated price lag (minutes):                1.1
  'Trap' instances detected:                    132 (66%)
  Average max mispricing:                       11.9 cents

  ** LATENCY ADVANTAGE DETECTED **
  Kalshi prices lag the BTC spot by ~1 minute(s).
  Market makers see index changes BEFORE the Kalshi UI updates.
  When you see a '2x payout', the smart money already knows it's dead.

  ** TRAP RATE: 66% **
  In 66% of longshot opportunities, the attractive payout
  appeared AFTER the spot price had already moved past recovery.
  This confirms the 'lagging indicator' hypothesis.

================================================================================
  SECTION 7: EXPECTED VALUE (EV) SUMMARY
================================================================================

  Longshot EV per $1 bet (>2x payout):          $-0.3227

  ** NEGATIVE EXPECTED VALUE **
  For every $1 bet on longshot contracts (>2x payout),
  you LOSE $0.32 on average.
  Over 100 bets at $1 each, expected loss: $32
  Over 1000 bets at $1 each, expected loss: $323

  The house edge on longshot bets is approximately 32.3%.

  EV by payout range:
        20x-100x: $-0.44 per $1 (n=60)
         10x-16x: $-0.25 per $1 (n=50)
         6.7x-9x: $+0.21 per $1 (n=38)
        5x-6.25x: $-0.07 per $1 (n=30)
         4x-4.8x: $-0.28 per $1 (n=36)
         3x-3.8x: $+0.30 per $1 (n=47)
         2x-2.9x: $-0.10 per $1 (n=106)

================================================================================
  SECTION 8: MINUTE-BY-MINUTE WIN RATES (Under $0.15)
================================================================================

  Win rate of contracts priced below $0.15 at each minute.
  Shows exactly when 'longshot' bets become mathematically dead.

================================================================================
  CONCLUSIONS & ACTIONABLE FINDINGS
================================================================================

  1. WHY 27/29 HAPPENS:
     The data CONFIRMS that chasing high payouts (>2x) during
     the BTC-15M series results in catastrophic loss streaks.
     Worst observed: favorite won 28/30 times.
     At 5 minutes remaining, binary time decay is brutal.
     The payout LOOKS attractive, but the actual probability
     has already collapsed far below what the price implies.

  2. THE 'STRUCTURAL OVERPRICING' MECHANISM:
     - 10x-16x: Priced at 8% win rate, actual is 6%
     - 4x-4.8x: Priced at 23% win rate, actual is 17%
     - 2x-2.9x: Priced at 42% win rate, actual is 38%
     The gap between 'implied' and 'actual' is where the
     house/market makers extract profit from retail.

  3. THE 'BOT ADVANTAGE':
     Kalshi prices lag BTC spot by ~1 minute(s).
     HFT bots see the index move before the UI updates.
     By the time a human sees a '5x payout', the bot
     already knows the true probability is ~0%.

  4. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
     a) NEVER buy contracts priced below $0.15 after minute 10
     b) The Point of No Return is minute 5 at $0.05
     c) If you want to trade longshots, only at T=0 (entry)
     d) Consider SELLING overpriced longshots instead of buying them
     e) The '5x payout' UI display is a psychological trap
